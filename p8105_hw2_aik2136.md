This problem focuses on NYC Transit data on entrances and exits of each subway station in NYC

### Reading and cleaning data

-   Read and clean the data
-   Retain line, station name, station latitude/longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance.
-   Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable

``` r
nyc_transit = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select("line", "station_name", "station_latitude", "station_longitude", "route1":"route11", "entry", "vending", "entrance_type", "ada") %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The `nyc_transit` dataset contains **1868 rows** and **19 columns**. This dataset consists of character variables such as `line` and `station_name` that describe the name of the station and where the line runs and coordinate variables (numeric) such as `station_latitutde` and `station_longitude` that describe the location of the entrance/exit of each station. Variables `route1` - `route11` (some character, some integers) tell us which trains (e.g. A, B, Q, 4, etc.) run through each station. Other variables including `vending` (character), `entrance_type`(character), `ada` (logical) and `entry` - which was converted from a character variable to a logical variable - were also included in the dataset.

The dataset was read in and `janitor::clean_names()` was utilized to clean the variable names. Next, `select` was implemented to select the above variables. Lastly, the `entry` variable was converted from a character to a logical variable by using `mutate` and `recode`. Yes, the data are tidy.

#### Answer the following questions:

##### How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
dist_num_station = (distinct(nyc_transit, station_name, line))
```

There are **465** distinct stations.

##### How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
ada_station = distinct(nyc_transit, station_name, line, ada) %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE)
```

There are **84** distinct ADA compliant stations.

##### What proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance?

``` r
no_vending = filter(nyc_transit, vending == "NO")
allow_entrance = filter(no_vending, entry == TRUE)
```

The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending that allow entrance is **0.3770492** (= **37.7%**).

### Reformatting data

Reformat so that route number and route name are distinct variables

``` r
route_reformat = nyc_transit %>%
  gather(key = route_number, value = route_name, route1:route11)
```

##### How many distinct stations serve the A train?

``` r
dist_a_station = distinct(route_reformat, line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(route_name == "A")
```

There are **60** distinct stations that serve the A train.

##### Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

``` r
dist_ada_a_station = filter(dist_a_station, ada == TRUE)
```

Of the distinct stations that serve the A train, there are **17** ADA compliant stations.
